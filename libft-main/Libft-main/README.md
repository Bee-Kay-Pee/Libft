A copy of my completed work for school 42's first project within the common core, Libft. 

Project guidelines and rules for this project are all under Libft.pdf. The pdf is all the infomation provided by the school to complete the project.

The libft folder passed all norminette / francinette checkers as of November 2023 and if things change after this for the schools norm checker or if your project requirments change then I am not going to be updating this repo.

libft_with_comments is my own notes and my own take on each line of code and I cant garentee that its corrrect. Feel free to let me know if you belive any of the notes are written incorrectly and I can update as to help any future students hoping to understand each area of the Libft project.
